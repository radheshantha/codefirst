Being a part of the Biotech society has reinforced my understanding of turning ideas into better ideas. The Biohackathon  that we hosted in November 2019 was a great success and we were absolutely thrilled to have so many people join us. It reminded me of what coming together to build something looks like and fostered a sense of community.
I have truly enjoyed being the the secretary of the Biotech society and I am looking forward to what follows. </p>
